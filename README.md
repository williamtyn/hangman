## Deployment
Because the online validator for PEP8 is currently offline. I´ve followed the steps that Kevin_ci on Code Institute provided.

As a workaround, you can add a PEP8 validator to your Gitpod Workspace directly by following these steps:
1. Run the command pip3 install pycodestyle  Note that this extension may already be installed, in which case this command will do nothing.
2. In your workspace, press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).
3. Type the word linter into the search bar that appears, and click on Python: Select Linter from the filtered results (image 1).
4. Select pycodestyle from the list (image 2).
5. PEP8 errors will now be underlined in red, as well as being listed in the PROBLEMS tab beside your terminal.
