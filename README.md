## Flowchart for project
To have some structure and to be able to understand which code and functions the program would have, i´ve created a flowchart using [Lucid](https://lucid.app/).

In the flowchart you can see thoe whole flow from start to end. All code based on the flowchart and beyond that i´va also added a function to choose nickname for player.

## Deployment
Because the online validator for PEP8 is currently offline. I´ve followed the steps that Kevin_ci on Code Institute provided.

As a workaround, you can add a PEP8 validator to your Gitpod Workspace directly by following these steps:
1. Run the command pip3 install pycodestyle  Note that this extension may already be installed, in which case this command will do nothing.
2. In your workspace, press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).
3. Type the word linter into the search bar that appears, and click on Python: Select Linter from the filtered results (image 1).
4. Select pycodestyle from the list (image 2).
5. PEP8 errors will now be underlined in red, as well as being listed in the PROBLEMS tab beside your terminal.

### User Story 1
As a player i want to play a wordgame against the computer to improve my spelling of english words.

*The player get the opportunity to improve their spelling of words in the hangman game. They player get hints of the word when the guess a letter and need to both use their vocabulary and spelling to guess the right word.*

### User Story 2
As a player i want to be able to to choose my own nickname or player name to feel more satisfied if i win the game.

*In the beginning of the game the player must choose a nickname to be able to play the game. If the player wins the get the Congrats message with their nickname, if they lose they get a well played message with their name.*

### User Story 3
As a player i want to be able to play the game many times with different words to keep practice my spelling.

*In the words list you find a lot of different word which reduces the risk of the random word to be picked again and at the same time the player get many different words to train their spelling with. At the end of each game the player have the option to play again " Do you want to play again? Y/N ".*

<h2 id="bugs">Bugs</h2>
If the player want to change their nickname they need to end and restart the whole program. If they choose to play again after win or lose the game repeats with the same nickname.

<h2 id="future-features">Future features</h2>

### Change nickname
In the future a feature for changing nickname could be applied if someone else want to play without cancelling the program and start over.
